# Project2
This project is comparing the CD4 transmembrane glycoproteins of T-cells in animal species that can contract immunodeficiency retroviruses similar to humans to animals that don't have a known contraction of immunodeficiency viruses.
# Scientific Question
How similar is the CD4 cell surface receptor of animal species that can contract immunodeficiency viruses to the CD4 of species that don't have known contraction of immunodeficiency viruses in terms of nucleotide sequence and protein structure?
# Scientific Hypothesis
If the presence of CD4 cell surface receptors is the gateway to different variations of immunodeficiency virus infection and pathogenesis, then the CD4 of species that can contract (such as chimpanzees and felines) will have some noticeable sequential or structural difference to those species that do not contract the disease.
# File Description
The fasta files include the amino acid sequences of the CD4 glycoprotein from the various species that are being compared to human CD4. The PDB files contian structural data on the MHC proteins of various species.
